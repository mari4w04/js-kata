# JS-KATA
## Week 23, Monday
### Forms & other fun stuff

Your task today is to create a small site that remembers the information about the user.

Setup a small form containing
- username
- email
- a field for the desired text-color (i.e. `color`)
- a field for the desired `background-color`
- other stuff you like

Whenever the user changes one of these, store the new value in `localStorage`;

Think of this as a "settings" page on a site.

When the page loads, make sure that: 
- the fields have the previously selected values
- The background-color of the site is whatever the user chose
- the text-color of the site is wahtever the user chose

The hardest part is probably the first time the page loads, before the user has stored anything :-)

Have fun
